This is Pokeclicker for Archipelago. It is not a standalone game and must be connected to an AP server to make progress.

The client is located at:
https://hallstead.github.io/AP-Pokeclicker/

Presently, to connect to the server:
- Enter your host address, port, and slot name (no password at the moment).
- Click the "Connect to Archipelago" button.
- Then click "New Save" or select the save you started previously with this slot.
## Complications will occur if you use a save from further in the game than where you should be, but starting a new save is always okay. ##
